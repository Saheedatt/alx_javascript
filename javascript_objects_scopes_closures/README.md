### Object-Oriented JavaScript Learning
In this project, we explored object-oriented JavaScript by solving a series of questions and implementing various classes to represent shapes such as rectangles and squares.

By working through these questions and implementing various classes, I gained a better understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. I learnt how to define classes, create constructors, handle inheritance, and add custom methods to classes. They are fundamental concepts for building complex applications in JavaScript.
