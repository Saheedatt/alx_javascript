# INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT -JavaScript WarmUp!
This repository documents the things I learnt this week in JavaScript and a brief summary of each completed tasks related to the language.

## Tasks
## Below are some of the things I practiced with:
- How to create variables and constants
- What are differences between var, const and let. The use of Var was completely avoided in all tasks.
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments to give a mini description of steps taken.
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use while and for loops. I learnt the difference between "for in" loops and "for of" loops when I was attempting task 3.
- What is a function and how to use functions. We had to write functions in most of the tasks.
- Scope of variables. I am not quite sure I understand how this works yet.
- Arithmetic operators and how to use them
- How to import a file


## Problems

During this learning journey, I covered various JavaScript concepts and and at the same time, I had issues with importing and using external files/modules. It took me a while and help from the discord groupchat to figure out how it works. This applied to the advanced tasks: tasks 100-103.

### I look forward to learning more and understanding Javascript better.
