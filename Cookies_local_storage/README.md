# Use of Cookies ^& Web Storage
This week, I learnt about the use of Javascript cookies and Web storage. It was quite tasking ngl.

## JavaScript Cookies
JavaScript cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side by a website. They are mainly used to store information about the user or the website's state.
I was able to complete the tasks that required me to:
- Create cookies by setting their properties such as name, value and expiration date.
- Reading Cookies.
- Deleting cookies by setting expiration date and time for them.
- Created a mini application to practice what was learnt.

## Web Storage
Web storage provides a more modern and efficient way to store data on the client-side compared to cookies and it is of two types: Local Storage and Session Storage. 
- I learnt how to use local storage to store key-value pairs that persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- I learnt how to use session storage to store key-value pairs that persist only for the duration of the page session.
- I basically learnt the difference between local storage and session storage. Got to try them out on the mini application created in [https://github.com/Saheedatt/alx_javascript/tree/main/Cookies_local_storage](7-index.html)

### Conclusion 
This week's exploration of JavaScript cookies and web storage has provided valuable insights into client-side data storage mechanisms. Understanding when and how to use cookies and web storage is crucial for building efficient and user-friendly web applications. By implementing these concepts, we can enhance user experiences and optimize web application performance.
