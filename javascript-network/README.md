# JAVASCRIPT NETWORK

This repository contains a collection of scripts and projects that showcase what I learnt this week, with a focus on data manipulation, making HTTP requests, using modern JavaScript features, and working with the file system.

## Contents

1. **0-statuscode.js**: A script that displays the status code of a GET request to a given URL using the request module.

2. **1-starwars_title.js**: A script that retrieves and prints the title of a Star Wars movie based on the episode number using the Star Wars API and the request module.

3. **2-starwars_count.js**: A script that counts the number of movies where the character "Wedge Antilles" is present using the Star Wars API and the request module.

4. **4-completed_tasks.js**: A script that computes the number of tasks completed by user ID from the JSONPlaceholder API and prints users with completed tasks using the request module.

5. **5-starwars_characters.js**: A script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie based on the Movie ID using the Star Wars API and the request module.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout these projects, the following key learning objectives have been addressed:

- **Manipulating JSON Data**: Understanding how to work with JSON data, including parsing and stringifying JSON objects, and accessing data within JSON structures.

- **Making HTTP Requests with the Request Module**: Learning to use the request module to make HTTP requests to external APIs, handle responses, and manage errors.

- **Using Modern JavaScript Features**: Exploring modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and async/await for writing cleaner and more efficient code.

- **Reading and Writing Files with the fs Module**: Gaining knowledge of the fs module to perform file operations, including reading data from files and writing data to files, with a focus on asynchronous and error-handling practices.
