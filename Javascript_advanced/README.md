# Javscript Concepts: Advanced Javascript
This file serves as a personal summary of what I learned this week in JavaScript. I was able to practice what I learnt with the questions provided by ALX and Holberton Schools.

## Lexical Scoping
Lexical scoping refers to how variable scope is determined by its location in the source code. Variables declared inside a function are scoped to that function, allowing functions to access variables from their containing functions.

### Closures
Closures are used by:
- Defining an outer function containing inner functions.
- Declaring variables in the outer function's scope.
- Returning or passing inner functions from the outer function.

#### Binding
Binding in JavaScript involves setting the this keyword's value within a function, often done using functions like bind, call, and apply.

#### Callbacks
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, commonly used for handling asynchronous operations.
